Use number keys 1 - 5 to select wire block or transistor blocks

Transistor blocks have one input side and 3 outpout side (Think minecraft redstone)

Left click adds the selected block to current mouse location, right click removes block

Mouse wheel zooms

Middle mouse dragging pans the view

Experiment and create cicuits using the wires and transistors to make invertors and inturn gates
and larger circuits.
